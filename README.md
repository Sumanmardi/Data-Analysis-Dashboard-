## Project Title: **Global Sales Analysis for a Plant Company using Power BI**

### Project Overview:
This project involves designing and developing an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to provide comprehensive insights into the global sales performance of a plant company operating in multiple countries. The goal is to enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by visualizing key metrics, trends, and patterns in sales data. The dashboard is tailored to help the company track its sales performance, identify growth opportunities, and optimize strategies across different regions.

 ## Process
 Hereâ€™s a concise process for a Power BI project aimed at analyzing the sales data of a multinational plant company:

## 1. **Project Planning & Requirements Gathering**
   - **Objective**: Understand the business goals (e.g., sales performance, trend analysis, regional profitability).
   - **Stakeholders**: Identify key stakeholders (e.g., sales managers, finance team, executives).
   - **Scope**: Define KPIs (e.g., revenue, units sold, sales growth, customer segmentation).

## 2. **Data Collection & Source Identification**
   - **Sales Data**: Extract sales transactions from ERP systems (e.g., SAP, Oracle).
   - **Additional Sources**: Collect data from CRM (e.g., customer demographics), and external data (e.g., market trends, weather data if relevant to plant sales).
   - **Formats**: Ensure data sources are accessible (SQL databases, Excel files, cloud storage).

## 3. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**
   - **Data Import**: Load data into Power BI using connectors.
   - **Data Transformation**: Use Power Query to clean data (e.g., remove duplicates, handle missing values, format dates).
   - **Data Modeling**:
     - Create relationships between tables (Fact tables: Sales, Dim tables: Date, Product, Region, Customer).
     - Build a **star schema** for optimal performance.

## 4. **Data Analysis & DAX Measures**
   - **Create Calculations**: Develop DAX measures for KPIs (e.g., Total Sales, YOY Growth, PYTD Sales, Sales by Region).
   - **Advanced Analysis**: Use DAX functions for trend analysis, forecasting, and cumulative totals.

## 5. **Report & Dashboard Development**
   - **Design**: Create intuitive reports with visuals (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, heat maps).
   - **Key Dashboards**:
     - **Executive Overview**: Sales summary, top-performing regions, and products.
     - **Regional Analysis**: Sales performance by country and city.
     - **Product Performance**: Analyze best-selling plants, seasonal trends.
     - **Customer Insights**: Segmentation by customer type, sales channels.
   - **Interactivity**: Add slicers, drill-throughs, and bookmarks for user-driven analysis.

## 6. **Testing & Validation**
   - **Data Accuracy**: Validate reports against source data for accuracy.
   - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Share with stakeholders for feedback.

## 7. **Deployment & Sharing**
   - **Publish Reports**: Deploy to Power BI Service.
   - **Access Control**: Set up row-level security (RLS) for sensitive data.
   - **Sharing**: Share reports via Power BI workspaces, email subscriptions, or Power BI apps.

## 8. **Training & Documentation**
   - **User Training**: Conduct training sessions for end-users.
   - **Documentation**: Provide a user guide for navigating dashboards.

## 9. **Maintenance & Optimization**
   - **Scheduled Refresh**: Set up data refresh schedules (e.g., daily, weekly).
   - **Performance Tuning**: Optimize DAX queries and data model for speed.
   - **Ongoing Support**: Monitor usage, address issues, and update reports as needed.
